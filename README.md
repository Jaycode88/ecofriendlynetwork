Our focus lies in creating a seamless, informative, and empowering online shopping experience that aligns with the values of those who care deeply about their environmental footprint, thereby setting a new standard in the realm of eco-conscious e-commerce.

    - **Eco-Friendly Lifestyle Adopters:**
    
        People who are in the process of transitioning to a more sustainable lifestyle. They are looking for accessible, affordable, and practical eco-friendly alternatives to everyday products.

    - **Ethical Shoppers:**

    - **Tech-Savvy Shoppers:**
    
        A demographic that prefers the convenience of online shopping and is inclined towards platforms that offer a seamless, user-friendly digital experience.

    By understanding and catering to these key segments, Eco Friendly Network aims to create a meaningful impact in the sphere of sustainable consumerism, making it easy and appealing for individuals to make choices that are good for them and the planet.

    Eco Friendly Network provides distinct value to our users through our focused selection of eco-friendly personal accessories and home essentials. Here's how we deliver value:

    - **Curated Eco-Friendly Selection:**

        Our platform specializes in a carefully chosen range of sustainable products, specifically in personal accessories like watches, bracelets, sunglasses, and home essentials in kitchenware, and bath & beauty products. This focus ensures that every item we offer aligns with eco-conscious values and practices.

    - **Quality and Sustainability:**
    
        Each product in our collection is selected for its quality and sustainable attributes. Whether it's a bamboo watch or a biodegradable beauty product, we ensure that our items meet high standards of both functionality and eco-friendliness.

    - **What makes a good experience ?**
    
        At Eco Friendly Network, we believe that a good user experience is fundamental to our mission and success. Here are the key elements that we focus on to ensure a positive and memorable experience for our users:

    - **Intuitive Navigation and Design:**
    
        A clean, user-friendly website design is crucial. Our platform is structured for ease of navigation, allowing users to effortlessly browse through categories of personal accessories, kitchen items, and bath & beauty products. This straightforward approach helps users find what they're looking for without hassle.

    - **High-Quality Product Imagery and Descriptions:**
    
        We understand the importance of accurately representing our products. High-resolution images and detailed descriptions give users a clear understanding of what they are purchasing, aiding in making informed decisions.

    - **Secure and Efficient Checkout Process:**
    
        A smooth and secure checkout process is vital. We employ robust security measures to protect user data, coupled with an efficient checkout process to make transactions quick and hassle-free.

- **What we shouldn't do?**

    In our pursuit to offer an exceptional and sustainable shopping experience at Eco Friendly Network, there are certain practices we consciously avoid:

    - **Overwhelming Our Users:**
    
        We steer clear of cluttering our platform with excessive product options or information. Keeping our range focused and our presentation clean ensures users can find what they need without feeling overwhelmed.

    - **Undermining Privacy and Security:**
    
        We do not compromise on the privacy and security of our user data. Avoiding practices that could put user information at risk is a top priority.

    - **Inconsistency in Values:**
    
        We avoid stocking products that don't align with our core values of sustainability and ethical responsibility. Every item we sell must contribute positively to our mission.

    - **Inadequate Product Descriptions and Imagery:**
    
        We avoid vague descriptions and low-quality images. Clear, accurate, and detailed product presentations are crucial for informed purchasing decisions.

    - **Making False Claims:**
    
        We strictly avoid exaggerating or misrepresenting the sustainability of our products. Honesty and transparency in how products are sourced and their impact are paramount.

    By consciously steering clear of these practices, Eco Friendly Network aims to build trust, ensure user satisfaction, and uphold our commitment to promoting sustainable consumer choices.

## UX
### Color Scheme

I researched colour schemes on [ShutterStock](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/sustainable-design-color-palettes). I decided to choose their pre-made "Clean Living theme(as seen below)
![colourscheme](documentation/colourscheme.webp)

### Color by color:

 - **Sage Green**
![SageGreen](documentation/sagegreen.webp)

     - Connection with Nature: Green hues are typically linked with nature, suggesting a sense of growth, renewal, and life. This particular shade of green, reminiscent of natural foliage, can evoke feelings of being grounded and connected to the natural world.

     - Balance and Harmony: Green is considered a color of balance and harmony, derived from its position in the color spectrum being in the middle of warm and cool tones. This shade of sage green, with its balanced mix of green and gray, can reinforce these qualities.

     - Health and Wellness: Often, green is associated with health and wellness. This might be due to its prevalent presence in healthy natural foods and its representation of vitality and freshness.

     - Sophistication and Elegance: The muted quality of this sage green can impart a sense of sophistication and understated elegance. It's often used in interior design to create a chic, yet calming atmosphere.

     - Subtlety and Softness: Unlike brighter or darker greens, this shade is more subtle and soft, which can create a more welcoming and less overwhelming space. It's often favored in design for its versatility and gentle appearance.

- **Tangerine**
![Tangerine](documentation/tangerine.webp)

    - Energy and Enthusiasm: Bright orange hues are often associated with energy, vibrancy, and excitement. They tend to evoke feelings of enthusiasm and can stimulate activity and social interaction.

    - Attention-Grabbing: Due to its high visibility, orange is used to catch attention and highlight the most important elements in a design. It can be used effectively to draw focus or emphasize key points.

    - Optimism and Positivity: Like other warm colors, orange is often linked with positivity and optimism. It's a color that can uplift moods and bring a sense of brightness and cheerfulness.

    - Creativity and Playfulness: Orange is considered a color that stimulates creativity and playfulness. It's seen as a fun, lively color that can encourage spontaneous and unconventional thinking.

- **Peach**
![Peach](documentation/peach.webp)

    - Youthfulness: Peach, with its soft and gentle tone, can convey a sense of playfulness and youthfulness. It's often associated with the play and innocence of childhood.

    - Gentleness and Soothing Quality: Unlike more saturated oranges, peach's muted quality gives it a more soothing presence. It's less stimulating and more calming, making it suitable for places where relaxation is key.

    - Nourishment and Comfort: Similar to other warm tones, peach can evoke a sense of nourishment and care, partly because of its resemblance to natural, healthy foods.

- **Silver Grey**
![SilverGrey](documentation/silvergrey.webp)

    - Neutrality and Balance: Gray is often considered a neutral and balanced color. It doesn't evoke strong emotions, making it a stable and calming presence in design and environment.

    - Modern and Sophisticated: Light gray is frequently associated with modernity and sophistication. It's commonly used in minimalist and contemporary designs, reflecting a sense of sleekness and refined taste.

    - Practicality and Timelessness: Being a classic and practical color, light gray is seen as timeless. It doesnâ€™t go out of style and can be easily integrated into various contexts and design themes.

It's important to note that the psychological impact of color is highly subjective and can vary based on cultural, personal, and situational factors. The interpretation of colors can differ greatly from person to person.

### Typography
I researched sustainable fonts on [Coconut Design](https://coconutdesign.eu/sustainable-website-fonts-and-the-proper-use-of-them/).

I chose Allan as my Headings font. This font appealed to me when I came accross it.

I chose Roboto for text due to its clear readabilty ans suitable contrast to the Allan Headings.

All of my fonts were provided by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

As a best practice, I have also included Sans Serif as a fallback font in The design. In cases where browsers or devices may not support the specific fonts mentioned above, we use a generic sans-serif font. This ensures that the text remains legible and maintains a consistent appearance across various platforms.
