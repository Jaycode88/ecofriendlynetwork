    - **Eco-Friendly Lifestyle Adopters:**
    
        People who are in the process of transitioning to a more sustainable lifestyle. They are looking for accessible, affordable, and practical eco-friendly alternatives to everyday products.

    - **Ethical Shoppers:**
    
        Customers who make purchasing decisions based on the social and environmental impact of products. They support brands and platforms that align with their values of ethical production, fair trade, and responsible business practices.

    - **Tech-Savvy Shoppers:**
    
        A demographic that prefers the convenience of online shopping and is inclined towards platforms that offer a seamless, user-friendly digital experience.

    By understanding and catering to these key segments, Eco Friendly Network aims to create a meaningful impact in the sphere of sustainable consumerism, making it easy and appealing for individuals to make choices that are good for them and the planet.

- **Value to the user?**

    Eco Friendly Network provides distinct value to our users through our focused selection of eco-friendly personal accessories and home essentials. Here's how we deliver value:

    - **Curated Eco-Friendly Selection:**

        Our platform specializes in a carefully chosen range of sustainable products, specifically in personal accessories like watches, bracelets, sunglasses, and home essentials in kitchenware, and bath & beauty products. This focus ensures that every item we offer aligns with eco-conscious values and practices.

    - **Quality and Sustainability:**
    
        Each product in our collection is selected for its quality and sustainable attributes. Whether it's a bamboo watch or a biodegradable beauty product, we ensure that our items meet high standards of both functionality and eco-friendliness.

    - **Personal Accessory and Home Essential Focus:**
    
        By specializing in specific categories, we provide users with a targeted shopping experience. Our range of personal accessories and home essentials caters to everyday needs, ensuring that users can easily incorporate sustainability into their daily lives.

    - **Contribution to a Greener Future:**
    
        Every purchase made on our platform is a step towards a more sustainable future. Users are not just buying a product; they are making a conscious choice to support environmentally friendly practices and reduce their ecological footprint.

    - **What makes a good experience ?**
    
        At Eco Friendly Network, we believe that a good user experience is fundamental to our mission and success. Here are the key elements that we focus on to ensure a positive and memorable experience for our users:

    - **Intuitive Navigation and Design:**
    
        A clean, user-friendly website design is crucial. Our platform is structured for ease of navigation, allowing users to effortlessly browse through categories of personal accessories, kitchen items, and bath & beauty products. This straightforward approach helps users find what they're looking for without hassle.

    - **High-Quality Product Imagery and Descriptions:**
    
        We understand the importance of accurately representing our products. High-resolution images and detailed descriptions give users a clear understanding of what they are purchasing, aiding in making informed decisions.

    - **Secure and Efficient Checkout Process:**
    
        A smooth and secure checkout process is vital. We employ robust security measures to protect user data, coupled with an efficient checkout process to make transactions quick and hassle-free.

- **What we shouldn't do?**

    In our pursuit to offer an exceptional and sustainable shopping experience at Eco Friendly Network, there are certain practices we consciously avoid:

    - **Overwhelming Our Users:**
    
        We steer clear of cluttering our platform with excessive product options or information. Keeping our range focused and our presentation clean ensures users can find what they need without feeling overwhelmed.

    - **Undermining Privacy and Security:**
    
        We do not compromise on the privacy and security of our user data. Avoiding practices that could put user information at risk is a top priority.

    - **Inconsistency in Values:**
    
        We avoid stocking products that don't align with our core values of sustainability and ethical responsibility. Every item we sell must contribute positively to our mission.

    - **Inadequate Product Descriptions and Imagery:**
    
        We avoid vague descriptions and low-quality images. Clear, accurate, and detailed product presentations are crucial for informed purchasing decisions.

    - **Making False Claims:**
    
        We strictly avoid exaggerating or misrepresenting the sustainability of our products. Honesty and transparency in how products are sourced and their impact are paramount.

    By consciously steering clear of these practices, Eco Friendly Network aims to build trust, ensure user satisfaction, and uphold our commitment to promoting sustainable consumer choices.

## UX
### Color Scheme

I researched colour schemes on [ShutterStock](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/sustainable-design-color-palettes). I decided to choose their pre-made "Clean Living theme(as seen below)
![colourscheme](documentation/colourscheme.webp)

### Color by color:

 - **Sage Green**
![SageGreen](documentation/sagegreen.webp)

     - Connection with Nature: Green hues are typically linked with nature, suggesting a sense of growth, renewal, and life. This particular shade of green, reminiscent of natural foliage, can evoke feelings of being grounded and connected to the natural world.

     - Balance and Harmony: Green is considered a color of balance and harmony, derived from its position in the color spectrum being in the middle of warm and cool tones. This shade of sage green, with its balanced mix of green and gray, can reinforce these qualities.

     - Health and Wellness: Often, green is associated with health and wellness. This might be due to its prevalent presence in healthy natural foods and its representation of vitality and freshness.

     - Sophistication and Elegance: The muted quality of this sage green can impart a sense of sophistication and understated elegance. It's often used in interior design to create a chic, yet calming atmosphere.

     - Subtlety and Softness: Unlike brighter or darker greens, this shade is more subtle and soft, which can create a more welcoming and less overwhelming space. It's often favored in design for its versatility and gentle appearance.

- **Tangerine**
![Tangerine](documentation/tangerine.webp)

    - Energy and Enthusiasm: Bright orange hues are often associated with energy, vibrancy, and excitement. They tend to evoke feelings of enthusiasm and can stimulate activity and social interaction.

    - Attention-Grabbing: Due to its high visibility, orange is used to catch attention and highlight the most important elements in a design. It can be used effectively to draw focus or emphasize key points.

    - Optimism and Positivity: Like other warm colors, orange is often linked with positivity and optimism. It's a color that can uplift moods and bring a sense of brightness and cheerfulness.

    - Creativity and Playfulness: Orange is considered a color that stimulates creativity and playfulness. It's seen as a fun, lively color that can encourage spontaneous and unconventional thinking.

- **Peach**
![Peach](documentation/peach.webp)

    - Youthfulness: Peach, with its soft and gentle tone, can convey a sense of playfulness and youthfulness. It's often associated with the play and innocence of childhood.

    - Gentleness and Soothing Quality: Unlike more saturated oranges, peach's muted quality gives it a more soothing presence. It's less stimulating and more calming, making it suitable for places where relaxation is key.

    - Nourishment and Comfort: Similar to other warm tones, peach can evoke a sense of nourishment and care, partly because of its resemblance to natural, healthy foods.

- **Silver Grey**
![SilverGrey](documentation/silvergrey.webp)

    - Neutrality and Balance: Gray is often considered a neutral and balanced color. It doesn't evoke strong emotions, making it a stable and calming presence in design and environment.

    - Modern and Sophisticated: Light gray is frequently associated with modernity and sophistication. It's commonly used in minimalist and contemporary designs, reflecting a sense of sleekness and refined taste.

    - Practicality and Timelessness: Being a classic and practical color, light gray is seen as timeless. It doesn’t go out of style and can be easily integrated into various contexts and design themes.

It's important to note that the psychological impact of color is highly subjective and can vary based on cultural, personal, and situational factors. The interpretation of colors can differ greatly from person to person.

### Typography
I researched sustainable fonts on [Coconut Design](https://coconutdesign.eu/sustainable-website-fonts-and-the-proper-use-of-them/).

#### Headings & Logo Font

![AllanFont](documentation/allan.webp)

I chose Allan as my Headings font. This font appealed to me due to its many characteristics and psychological impacts, Including:

- **Bold and Assertive:** Allan is known for its bold strokes, making it assertive and attention-grabbing. This feature is excellent for headings as it draws the reader's eye and establishes a hierarchy in the text.

- **Friendly and Approachable:** Despite its boldness, Allan has a certain roundness and softness to its characters, which can convey a sense of friendliness and approachability. This can make your content feel more inviting to readers.

- **Modern with a Touch of Playfulness:** The font has a modern look with a slight touch of playfulness. This can be great for engaging a wide range of audiences without being too formal or too casual.

- **Excellent Readability:** Allan maintains high readability even in larger sizes, which is crucial for headings. This ensures that titles are easily legible, enhancing the overall user experience and facilitating better content navigation.

- **Aesthetic Appeal:** The stylistic flair of Allan adds a visual interest to the headings, contributing to the overall aesthetic appeal of the web Application.

#### Body Text

![RobotoFont](documentation/roboto.webp)

I chose Roboto for body text due suitable contrast to the Allan Headings, As well as its versatile characteristics and psychological impacts, including:

- **Clarity and Readability:** Roboto is renowned for its high legibility, which is essential for body text. Its clean and unambiguous letterforms ensure that content is easily readable, even in smaller sizes or dense paragraphs.

- **Modern and Minimalist Design:** With its geometric forms and open curves, Roboto has a modern and minimalist aesthetic. This design complements contemporary layouts and interfaces, providing a sleek and up-to-date look.

- **Subtle Personality:** Unlike more decorative fonts, Roboto offers a subtle personality that doesn't overpower the content. Its character lies in its functionality, supporting the text rather than taking center stage.

- **Enhancing User Experience:** Given its legibility and aesthetic neutrality, Roboto enhances the user experience by making the reading process effortless and pleasant, which is crucial for engaging and retaining the audience.

All of my fonts were provided by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

As a best practice, I have also included Sans Serif as a fallback font in The design. In cases where browsers or devices may not support the specific fonts mentioned above, we use a generic sans-serif font. This ensures that the text remains legible and maintains a consistent appearance across various platforms.

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jaycode88/ecofriendlynetwork) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/Jaycode88/ecofriendlynetwork.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Jaycode88/ecofriendlynetwork)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

When working with this project, it's important to understand the differences between running the application locally and deploying it to Heroku:

Local Development: Running the application locally is ideal for development and testing purposes. You can make changes, test new features, and experiment with the code in a controlled environment.

Heroku Deployment: Deploying the application to Heroku makes it accessible to a wider audience on the web. It's suitable for sharing your project with others and providing a public URL for access.

Choose the deployment option that best suits your needs and project goals.

Always follow the steps and ensure that your sensitive information(API Keys, Database credentials, etc) are not visible to the public.
