## UX
### Color Scheme

I researched colour schemes on [ShutterStock](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/sustainable-design-color-palettes). I decided to choose their pre-made "Clean Living theme" . I did decide to replace their selection of #FB9B27(Tangerine) with #A8671A(Burnt Sienna) for contrast reasons.
![colourscheme](documentation/colourscheme.webp)

### Color by color:

 - **Sage Green**
![SageGreen](documentation/sagegreen.webp)

     - Connection with Nature: Green hues are typically linked with nature, suggesting a sense of growth, renewal, and life. This particular shade of green, reminiscent of natural foliage, can evoke feelings of being grounded and connected to the natural world.

     - Balance and Harmony: Green is considered a color of balance and harmony, derived from its position in the color spectrum being in the middle of warm and cool tones. This shade of sage green, with its balanced mix of green and gray, can reinforce these qualities.

     - Health and Wellness: Often, green is associated with health and wellness. This might be due to its prevalent presence in healthy natural foods and its representation of vitality and freshness.

     - Sophistication and Elegance: The muted quality of this sage green can impart a sense of sophistication and understated elegance. It's often used in interior design to create a chic, yet calming atmosphere.

     - Subtlety and Softness: Unlike brighter or darker greens, this shade is more subtle and soft, which can create a more welcoming and less overwhelming space. It's often favored in design for its versatility and gentle appearance.

- **Burnt Sienna**
![Burnt Sienna](documentation/burntsienna.webp)

    - Earthiness and Warmth: The color Burnt Sienna, with its deep, rich earth tone, embodies warmth and a grounded feeling. It is reminiscent of natural elements like soil and autumn leaves, bringing a sense of warmth and comfort to designs.

    - Stability and Strength: This shade of brown is often associated with stability and reliability. It can convey a sense of strength and resilience, making it a good choice for designs that aim to evoke feelings of security and dependability.

    - Rustic Charm: Burnt Sienna has a rustic quality that can add a charming, old-world feel to a design. It's ideal for themes that aim to reflect tradition, heritage, or a connection with the past.

    - Sophistication and Depth: As a deeper and more complex color than brighter oranges or yellows, Burnt Sienna provides a sophisticated palette. It can lend depth and richness to a design, making it suitable for elegant and refined themes.

	- Nostalgia and Comfort: This color can evoke feelings of nostalgia and comfort, reminiscent of cozy, autumnal settings. It's a color that can make a space or design feel more inviting and homely.

    - Youthfulness: Peach, with its soft and gentle tone, can convey a sense of playfulness and youthfulness. It's often associated with the play and innocence of childhood.

    - Gentleness and Soothing Quality: Unlike more saturated oranges, peach's muted quality gives it a more soothing presence. It's less stimulating and more calming, making it suitable for places where relaxation is key.

    - Nourishment and Comfort: Similar to other warm tones, peach can evoke a sense of nourishment and care, partly because of its resemblance to natural, healthy foods.

- **Silver Grey**
![SilverGrey](documentation/silvergrey.webp)

    - Neutrality and Balance: Gray is often considered a neutral and balanced color. It doesn't evoke strong emotions, making it a stable and calming presence in design and environment.

    - Modern and Sophisticated: Light gray is frequently associated with modernity and sophistication. It's commonly used in minimalist and contemporary designs, reflecting a sense of sleekness and refined taste.

    - Practicality and Timelessness: Being a classic and practical color, light gray is seen as timeless. It doesn’t go out of style and can be easily integrated into various contexts and design themes.

It's important to note that the psychological impact of color is highly subjective and can vary based on cultural, personal, and situational factors. The interpretation of colors can differ greatly from person to person.

### Typography
I researched sustainable fonts on [Coconut Design](https://coconutdesign.eu/sustainable-website-fonts-and-the-proper-use-of-them/).

#### Headings & Logo Font

![AllanFont](documentation/allan.webp)

I chose Allan as my Headings font. This font appealed to me due to its many characteristics and psychological impacts, Including:

- **Bold and Assertive:** Allan is known for its bold strokes, making it assertive and attention-grabbing. This feature is excellent for headings as it draws the reader's eye and establishes a hierarchy in the text.

- **Friendly and Approachable:** Despite its boldness, Allan has a certain roundness and softness to its characters, which can convey a sense of friendliness and approachability. This can make your content feel more inviting to readers.

- **Modern with a Touch of Playfulness:** The font has a modern look with a slight touch of playfulness. This can be great for engaging a wide range of audiences without being too formal or too casual.

- **Excellent Readability:** Allan maintains high readability even in larger sizes, which is crucial for headings. This ensures that titles are easily legible, enhancing the overall user experience and facilitating better content navigation.

- **Aesthetic Appeal:** The stylistic flair of Allan adds a visual interest to the headings, contributing to the overall aesthetic appeal of the web Application.

#### Body Text

![RobotoFont](documentation/roboto.webp)

I chose Roboto for body text due suitable contrast to the Allan Headings, As well as its versatile characteristics and psychological impacts, including:

- **Clarity and Readability:** Roboto is renowned for its high legibility, which is essential for body text. Its clean and unambiguous letterforms ensure that content is easily readable, even in smaller sizes or dense paragraphs.

- **Modern and Minimalist Design:** With its geometric forms and open curves, Roboto has a modern and minimalist aesthetic. This design complements contemporary layouts and interfaces, providing a sleek and up-to-date look.

- **Subtle Personality:** Unlike more decorative fonts, Roboto offers a subtle personality that doesn't overpower the content. Its character lies in its functionality, supporting the text rather than taking center stage.

- **Enhancing User Experience:** Given its legibility and aesthetic neutrality, Roboto enhances the user experience by making the reading process effortless and pleasant, which is crucial for engaging and retaining the audience.

#### Fallback Font
![Sans Serif](documentation/sanserif.webp)

As a best practice, I have also included Sans Serif as a fallback font in The design. In cases where browsers or devices may not support the specific fonts mentioned above, we use a generic sans-serif font. This ensures that the text remains legible and maintains a consistent appearance across various platforms.

All of my fonts were provided by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Future Features

- **Pagination**
	The Store only currently has A few starter products, As the range of products increases there will be a lot displayed on the products page. I believe it will be nessacerry to add Pagination to enhace the user experience. This also applys to the Blog page as the amount of Blog posts increase.

- **Blog Search and Filter Functionality**
	As the number of blog posts on Eco Friendly Network increases, introducing a search feature will greatly enhance user experience. This functionality will allow users to quickly find blogs by keywords, authors, or topics, making the content more accessible and navigable.

- **User Statistics(For Admin)**
	A dedicated section for superusers to view comprehensive statistics about user activities. This dashboard could include metrics such as most ordered products, user order histories, frequency of purchases, and other relevant data. This feature would aid in making informed business and stock decisions. This feature would sit nicely along with the other Statistics features already included in the Site.

- **User Reviews and Ratings**
	Implementing a system where users can rate and review products and blog posts. This feature not only fosters a sense of community but also provides valuable feedback for continuous improvement. Currently ratings are displayed for products but these are taken from the supplier of the products rather than made by Eco Friendly Network's Users. I believe it would be better for both users and Admin that the ratings figure were coming directly from the store rather than the product source.

- **Share to Social Media**
	Enabling users to share their favorite products, blogs, or their own shopping experiences directly to social media platforms. This feature could increase the visibility of Eco Friendly Network and drive more traffic to the site.

## Database Design
During the development phase, I utilized SQLite for its simplicity and ease of configuration, which facilitated rapid prototyping and streamlined testing processes. This project employs Django's ORM capabilities within a relational database architecture to efficiently manage data interactions. While the initial stages relied on SQLite due to its straightforward setup and integration with Django, the transition towards deployment necessitated a more scalable and robust database solution.

For the deployed version of the application, I chose ElephantSQL and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure enhanced performance, reliability, and scalability. ElephantSQL offers a managed PostgreSQL service that seamlessly integrates with our Django application, providing the robustness required for production without the overhead of database administration. Additionally, leveraging AWS for hosting and related services further solidifies the application's infrastructure, offering high availability, security, and the flexibility to scale resources according to demand.

## Marketing & Branding
I have Created a Facebook Page for Eco Friendly Network [View Here](https://www.facebook.com/Ecofriendlynetwork/), The page is created to be used as a crucial marketing channel with a singular focus: to direct people to The Eco Friendly Network Store. With the page I aim to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to the store, where customers can explore and purchase products.

	- Any custom name, such as "Django" or ecofriendlynetwork
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

### Local VS Deployment

When working with this project, understanding the differences in database configurations between local development and deployment environments is essential:

#### Local Development:

 - **Database:** For local development, the application uses SQLite. SQLite's simplicity and ease of configuration make it an ideal choice for development and testing phases. It allows developers to quickly make changes, test new features, and experiment with the code in a controlled environment without the need for complex database setup.
 - **Environment:** Running the application locally is geared towards development and testing. This setup provides a quick feedback loop for code changes, facilitating rapid prototyping and debugging.

#### Deployment:

 - **Database:** Upon deployment, the application transitions to using ElephantSQL for PostgreSQL database services and leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting and additional cloud-based resources. This shift to more robust and scalable database solutions ensures the application can handle increased traffic and data loads efficiently, providing a seamless user experience.
 - **Environment:** Deploying the application to Heroku and integrating with AWS services makes it accessible to a wider audience on the web. This environment is optimized for performance, security, and reliability, making it suitable for production use and sharing your project with stakeholders and the public.

#### Key Considerations:
 - **Data Migration:** Ensure that any necessary data migrations are performed when transitioning from local development to the deployed environment, especially when moving from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
 - **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to manage sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, etc.) securely. This practice prevents sensitive data exposure and allows for flexible configuration changes between different environments.

#### Conclusion:
Choosing between local development and deployment involves considering your project's current needs and goals. While local development offers a convenient and fast way to develop and test features, deployment brings your application into a real-world setting, ready for users. By understanding and managing the differences in database configurations between these environments, you can ensure a smooth transition and maintain data integrity and application performance throughout the development lifecycle.

Always follow best practices for security, especially in handling sensitive information and configuring your databases for both local and deployed environments.
