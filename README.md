## Strategy

### The 5 Planes

- **Purpose of the website?**

- **Target audience?**

- **Value to the user?**

- **What makes a good experience ?**

- **What we shouldn't do?**

### The Why

### The Business Goal

## UX
### Color Scheme

### Color by color:

### Typography
I researched sustainable fonts on [Coconut Design](https://coconutdesign.eu/sustainable-website-fonts-and-the-proper-use-of-them/).

I chose Allan as my Headings font. This font appealed to me when I came accross it.

I chose Roboto for text due to its clear readabilty ans suitable contrast to the Allan Headings.

All of my fonts were provided by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

As a best practice, I have also included Sans Serif as a fallback font in The design. In cases where browsers or devices may not support the specific fonts mentioned above, we use a generic sans-serif font. This ensures that the text remains legible and maintains a consistent appearance across various platforms.
