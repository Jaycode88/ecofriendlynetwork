# Testing
Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

I have used various tools to Test Funcionality, Validity and responsiveness. I have been sure to check all layouts, colours, text, forms, links, buttons are functioning on all devices and screen sizes that I have tested.

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files. I checked validated by both URI and Copying and pasting the rendered page's source code into the checker.

- **Results:**

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate my JS files. I used version 11 which does not throw errors due to use of ES6 syntax, Aswell as informing JSHint that I was intenionally using jQuery. To do so I have added the following line to the top of my script.js file:
```
/* jshint esversion: 11, jquery: true */
```

### PEP8

I have used [Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) (Provided by CodeInstitute) to check all Python files are PEP8 compliant.
