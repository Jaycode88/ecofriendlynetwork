# Testing
Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

I have used various tools to Test Funcionality, Validity and responsiveness. I have been sure to check all layouts, colours, text, forms, links, buttons are functioning on all devices and screen sizes that I have tested.

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files. I checked validated by both URI and Copying and pasting the rendered page's source code into the checker.

    ![Checkout CSS Valid](documentation/checkoutcssvalid.webp)

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate my JS files. I used version 11 which does not throw errors due to use of ES6 syntax, Aswell as informing JSHint that I was intenionally using jQuery. To do so I have added the following line to the top of my scripts:
```
/* jshint esversion: 11, jquery: true */
```

- **Results**

    - Countryfield.js
    ![Countryfield JS Valid](documentation/countryfieldjsvalid.webp)

## Automated Testing
### Jest Testing JQuery
When it chame to testing JQuery, I beame a little lost due to following the file structure of my django learning material I had JQuery code all over the place(at the bottom of html templates, in html includes etc.). This made being able to test with jest very tricky. With a bit of research and advice from a CodeInstitute graduate, It was nessacery for me to rearrange the file structure of my static files. To see the precise changes made please refer to commits [3f348c3](https://github.com/Jaycode88/ecofriendlynetwork/commit/3f348c33e81057aedeeac721aff42deb6bc4dbb3) & [ef5c9e4](https://github.com/Jaycode88/ecofriendlynetwork/commit/ef5c9e4a209ac06c4f508ba95eca7d46ded3f6e0). From there I was ready to start setting up testing.

#### Jest Setup

I first needed to ensure npm was initialized using command:
```npm init -y``` in the terminal. This command creates a 'package.json' file in the project directory which tracks the JavaScript dependencies.

Then I needed to install not only 'Jest' but 'babel-jest' and '@babel/present-env' to ensure modern features are supported which are not supported in Node.js, I also needed to install 'jest-environment-jsdom' to simulate the browsers environment in the tests as I am testing JQuery. To do all of this I used the one following command:
```
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest @babel/preset-env jest-environment-jsdom
```

It was then nessacery to create a 'babel.config.json' file in the project directory, with its contents as folllows:(This file tells babel which presets to use)
```
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

I then needed to tell Jest how to find the javascript files and which environment to use for testing. for this i created a 'jest.config.js' file in the project root with the following configuration:
```
module.exports = {
    testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
    moduleDirectories: [
      "node_modules",
      // path to  JavaScript files 
      "<ecofriendlynetwork>/static/js"
    ],
    transform: {
      // Transform files with a .js or .jsx extension using babel-jest
      "^.+\\.jsx?$": "babel-jest"
    },
  };
```

Next I located the 'package.json' file in the root directory and added script to easily run tests:
```
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

I then created a sample test file in my static/js directory 'example.test.js' withthe following sample test:
```
describe('Example test', () => {
    test('true to be true', () => {
      expect(true).toBe(true);
    });
  });
```

I then ran the test using command ```npm test```. The test pass concluding my setup is correct. I could then remove the sample test file and start writing real tests.

![Example Test Pass](documentation/examplejestpass.webp)

#### Writing tests
I first started with some simple tests for bag_incdec_remove file, Upon trying to run the test I found I also needed to install jQuery as a dependencie using command:
```npm install jquery```

Even after this I ran into issues with jest testing jQuery (See Below)
#### Jest testing jQuery Issues 
During the initial testing phase of the project, I encountered several challenges while attempting to use Jest for testing jQuery-based DOM manipulations and event handling within the application. Despite Jest's strengths in unit testing JavaScript code, My specific use case—testing complex interactions with the DOM—presented unique difficulties.

##### Challenges Encountered
**Mocking Complexity:** I faced significant challenges in effectively mocking jQuery methods, such as $.fn.val, to test DOM updates triggered by user interactions (e.g., clicking to increment or decrement item quantities). Despite implementing mock functions and attempting to simulate user actions, the tests failed to accurately capture the interactions and resulted in false negatives.
**Event Handling Issues:** My tests consistently struggled with correctly simulating click events and verifying the subsequent DOM manipulations. Even after ensuring correct event binding and attempting both direct and mocked event triggers, the expected changes in input values were not consistently detected in the Jest environment.
**Asynchronous Operations:** Handling AJAX calls and form submissions within Jest proved problematic. Although I mocked these operations, aligning them with the synchronous flow of unit tests while ensuring realistic simulation of user actions was complex and often led to inconclusive test outcomes.

##### Troubleshooting Steps
To address these issues, I undertook a comprehensive troubleshooting process that included:

**Directly Mocking jQuery Functions:** I attempted to directly mock jQuery's core functions, such as val, to control and assert their interactions within the tests.
**Simplifying Test Cases:** I reduced test complexity by focusing on direct DOM manipulation and bypassing more complex interactions, aiming for a more granular understanding of the failure points.
**Manual Event Triggers:** I used jQuery to manually trigger events in an effort to more closely mimic user interactions, though this too did not yield consistent results.

### Jest Testing Vanilla Javascript
After failing to test my jQuery code, I attempted to convert my jQuery into Vanilla Javascript within a seperate file, I then attempted to write tests for the javascript with Jest.(This method worked for me in a previous project)

#### Jest Testing Vanilla Javascript Issues
Despite my efforts to enhance test coverage for the application, I faced significant challenges while attempting to use Jest for testing vanilla JavaScript, specifically for scripts handling DOM manipulations and user event simulations. These obstacles prompted a reconsideration of my testing approach.

##### Encountered Challenges
**DOM Manipulation and Event Handling:** Testing DOM updates and event listeners presented difficulties, particularly when simulating user actions like clicks. These challenges were compounded by Jest's simulated DOM environment, which doesn't always replicate browser behaviors accurately.

**Mocking Limitations:** I attempted to mock global objects such as window.location to test navigation and reload scenarios. However, Jest's environment restrictions on modifying certain properties led to TypeError issues, complicating my testing efforts.

**Asynchronous Behavior:** Properly testing asynchronous operations, including AJAX requests and their effects on the DOM, proved to be complex within Jest's testing framework. This complexity was due to Jest's handling of asynchronous code and the need for precise mocking of fetch requests and responses.

##### Troubleshooting Steps
In response to these challenges, I undertook several steps to address and mitigate the issues:

**Mocking Strategies:** I explored various strategies for mocking global objects and functions, including using jest.fn() and Object.defineProperty, to bypass limitations in modifying read-only properties.

**Event Simulation Refinement:** I refined my approach to simulating user events, experimenting with different methods to trigger event handlers directly or using Jest's utilities to simulate events more reliably.

##### Conclusion
While Jest remains a robust solution for unit testing in many JavaScript applications, My specific requirements for testing DOM manipulations, event handling, and asynchronous behavior necessitated a stronger understanding of Jest than I have. I did research another testing format called "Cypress" but encountered many complexities during the setup.

To view the Jest Testing Terminal logs [Click Here](documentation/jestlog.csv)

### Python unit testing
#### Process

I Added a number of tests within each apps tests.py file. To run the tests the terminal command is:
 ``python manage.py test``

or for a more verbose output the --verbosity flag can be used:
``python manage.py test --verbosity=2``

I prefer to recieve a html coverage report so installed coverage using command:
``pip install coverage``

Then it is required to run the Django tests using coverage to measure code coverage, using command:
``coverage run --source='.' manage.py test``
This leaves a file within the project named ".coverage"(do not delete it yet)

To Generate the HTML report the command ``coverage html
`` is used, This creates a HTML report from the ".coverage" file previously mentioned.. You will find the Report in a new directory in your project named "htmlcov" it is a file named "index.html". (It is best to not push the htmlcov directory to your repo, Add it to .gitignore instead) You can also delete the ".coverage" file now you have the report also.

#### Results

I  managed to reach coverage of 78% In a real world scenario in which I had a Little more time to complete I would of liked to Reach 100% coverage.

## Bugs
### Fixed Bugs

- **Increment/Decrement Buttons**
    When Attempting to create the functionality for the shopping bag to be updated upon the click of the increment or decrement button being pushed rather than needing a submit button: I came accross great difficulty in that when i was pressing the increment or decrement buttons the no. of items value would increment or decrement by 2 rather than 1 When I tried to fix this I would get varying results mainly the buttons not disabling and enabling correctly or the increment and decrements going in values of 2. After a lot of time debugging I realised it was due to using the quantity input script in the bag template as I was changing the function it was nessacerry to completely  rewrite the code for the bag template and leave the quantity input script for the product details page only.

- **Custom Clearable file input**
    I was recieving the following error when attempting to load my add or edit product pages:
    ![File Input Error](documentation/customfileerror.webp)
    I found it was due to line 43/44 in my checkouts webhooks.py I had attempted to seperate lines to comply with PEP8 but I found This effected the code so the line had to be complete as one with a # noqa after it.
    ![File Input Fix](documentation/customfilefix.webp)

- **Email Confirmation**
    I found that on my deployed site order confirmation emails were not being sent. After much time looking over code and not finding the issue my mentor suggested checking that the webhook endpoint was correct in my Stripe settings. My mentor was right my Stripe webhook endpoint was still set to my site preview rather than my deployed site.

- **Sales Stats Favorites Count**
    The application was displaying inconsistent counts of how many users had marked a product as a favorite in the sales_stats app compared to the products app. The sales_stats app's count of favorites per product was incorrect, potentially leading to misleading data representation in the sales statistics.

    The discrepancy was caused by the way the total_favorites was calculated in the sales_stats view. Initially, the count of favorites might have included duplicate counts or was affected by other filters applied to the sales data, such as date ranges.

    Therefore the line of code responsible for counting the total number of favorites for each product in the sales_stats view was modified:

- **Signup Html Validation Error**
When attempting to validate HTML on the sign up page I was recieving the following error:
![Sign up HTML validation error](documentation/signuperror.webp).
It was suggested that the problem was due to an incompatability between the versions of packages I had installed particuraly Allauth, Django and Crispy Forms,  but when checking this I could not find an issue.
The only other option I had was to manually render the form in the signup.html rather than use crispy forms.

- **validation issues**
Whilst validating the HTML for the Profile, Add Prduct, Edit product, Add Blog, Edit Blog, Order Stats, Product Stats, View Order and Forgot Password pages, I recieved and info note(not an error) Regarding avoiding trailing slashes on void elements(see images)
![Profile Valid info image](documentation/profilebug.webp)
![Add Product Valid info image](documentation/addproductbug.webp)
![Edit Product Valid info image](documentation/editproductbug.webp)
![Add Blog Valid info image](documentation/addblogbug.webp)
![Edit Blog Valid info image](documentation/editblogbug.webp)
![Order Stats Valid info image](documentation/orderstatsbug.webp)
![Product Stats Valid info image](documentation/productstatsbug.webp)
![View Order Valid info image](documentation/vieworderbug.webp)
![Forgot Password Valid info image](documentation/forgotbug.webp)

I suspect this is due to a mis match in compatability between the versions of packages I have installed but as mentioned before I could not pin point this. As the validation note is only an info point and not a validation error or warning, I chose not to modify all the forms in a similar manner of which I did with the Signup error in the interest of completing the project on time.

In an ideal scenario in which I had more time to complete I would of liked to look further into this and resolve the issue completely.

- **Blog posts**
It is known to me that it is required for the user to use html in order to achieve layout wishes when typing in the text area.
How ever I noticed that It is nessacery to leave the last paragraph closing tag out. As if included it causes a validation error for the blog detail pages due to 2 closing tags.
